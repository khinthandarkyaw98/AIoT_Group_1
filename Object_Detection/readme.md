### Object Detection
<hr>
<p>Object detection is a computer vision task that involves identifying objects within an image or video stream and classifying them into predefined categories. YOLO (You Only Look Once) is an efficient real-time object detection algorithm that can detect multiple objects in an image with high accuracy and speed. YOLO uses a single neural network to simultaneously predict bounding boxes and class probabilities for each object in an image, which makes it faster and more accurate than other object detection algorithms. The YOLO algorithm divides the input image into a grid of cells and predicts the bounding box and class probabilities for each cell. The predicted bounding boxes are then refined using non-maximum suppression to eliminate duplicate detections. YOLO has become a popular choice for object detection in real-world applications such as autonomous driving, surveillance, and robotics.</p>
#### Reasons of using YOLO v4
<hr>
<p>There are several reasons why YOLO v4 should be considered for object detection tasks. Firstly, YOLO v4 achieves state-of-the-art accuracy in object detection on several benchmark datasets, such as COCO and Pascal VOC, outperforming previous versions of YOLO and other popular object detection algorithms.Secondly, YOLO v4 is designed to be more efficient than previous versions, making it suitable for real-time applications on devices with limited computational resources. It achieves this by using a more efficient backbone architecture, implementing spatial pyramid pooling, and optimizing the network for faster inference.Thirdly, YOLO v4 includes several improvements in its training and inference pipelines, such as dynamic anchor assignment, enhanced data augmentation, and feature map aggregation, which contribute to the improved accuracy and efficiency of the algorithm. Overall, YOLO v4 is a powerful and versatile object detection algorithm that can be used for a wide range of applications, from autonomous driving to object tracking in surveillance systems. Its high accuracy, efficiency, and ease of use make it a compelling choice for computer vision researchers and practitioners.</p>
